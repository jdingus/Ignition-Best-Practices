# Gateway Configuration Best Practices

## Overview
Proper Gateway configuration is critical to ensuring stability, maintainability, and performance in Ignition projects. Below are best practices for setting up and managing Gateway configurations.

## Tips and Recommendations

- **Use Meaningful Names**
  - Name devices, databases, and authentication profiles descriptively to make their purpose clear.

- **Document Configuration Differences**
  - Maintain a record of environment-specific differences such as IP addresses, database connections, or authentication settings.

- **Avoid Full Gateway Backups for Deployments**
  - Full backups overwrite all settings, making selective updates difficult.

- **Leverage EAM Controller Gateways**
  - Use the Enterprise Administration Module (EAM) for centralized management, including:
    - Health diagnostics
    - Automated backups
    - Disaster recovery
    - Remote upgrades

- **Configure Gateway Security**
  - Implement role-based authentication and secure connections (HTTPS) to protect sensitive data.

- **Schedule Regular Backups**
  - Automate Gateway backups at regular intervals to ensure quick recovery in case of failure.

- **Version Control for Gateway Changes**
  - Track Gateway configuration changes manually using external tools or documents. This is especially useful for documenting differences across development, testing, and production environments.

## Common Configuration Areas

- **Devices and Connections**
  - Ensure device configurations (PLCs, OPC connections) are properly tested and monitored.

- **Database Connections**
  - Use meaningful connection names. Match environment-specific database configurations without altering connection names to maintain compatibility.

- **Authentication Profiles**
  - Use separate profiles for different environments to prevent cross-environment interference.

- **Alarm Notification Profiles**
  - Test notification profiles (e.g., email or SMS) in non-production environments before deployment.

- **Redundancy Settings**
  - Configure redundancy only in production environments unless explicitly needed elsewhere.
