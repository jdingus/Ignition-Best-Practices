# Gateway Scripting Best Practices

## Overview
Gateway scripts allow you to automate tasks and implement logic at the Gateway level. These scripts can handle scheduled tasks, respond to events, and more. Proper organization and adherence to best practices ensure maintainability and performance.

## Tips and Recommendations

- **Follow PEP-8 Standards**
  - Adhere to Python's PEP-8 style guide for consistency and readability.
  - Use `camelCase` for variable and function names to align with Ignition conventions.

- **Organize Scripts in the Project Library**
  - Use descriptive folder and script names, such as `exchange.utilities.logging`.
  - Store reusable functions in dedicated scripts for modularity.

- **Use Logging Effectively**
  - Implement hierarchical logger names like `exchange.resourceName.scriptName`.
  - Use different logging levels (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`) to manage output verbosity.

- **Avoid Blocking Code**
  - Do not use blocking calls like `time.sleep` in scripts, as they can impact Gateway performance.
  - Use asynchronous or scheduled tasks instead for long-running operations.

- **Comment and Document**
  - Add single-line comments (`#`) or multi-line docstrings (`"""`).
  - Document script purpose, inputs, and outputs for better maintainability.

- **Error Handling**
  - Use `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
  - Log error details for debugging purposes.

- **Version Control for Scripts**
  - Store scripts in a source control system like Git for tracking changes and collaboration.

## Common Use Cases

- **Scheduled Tasks**
  - Use Gateway Timer Scripts for periodic tasks.
  - Example: Generating daily reports or cleaning up old data.

- **Event-Driven Automation**
  - Implement Gateway Event Scripts to handle tag changes, device connections, or other events.
  - Example: Sending notifications when critical tags exceed thresholds.

- **Database Interaction**
  - Use `system.db.runPrepQuery` and `system.db.runPrepUpdate` for safe SQL execution.
  - Avoid hardcoding queries; parameterize them for flexibility and security.

- **External System Integration**
  - Use scripting to interact with external systems via APIs, MQTT, or file exchanges.
