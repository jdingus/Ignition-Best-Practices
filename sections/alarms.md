# Alarm Notification Pipelines Best Practices

## Overview
Alarm Notification Pipelines allow you to manage the flow of alarm notifications in Ignition, including escalations, delays, and custom logic. Proper configuration ensures alarms are effectively routed to the appropriate recipients while reducing nuisance notifications.

## Tips and Recommendations

- **Use Clear and Descriptive Names**
  - Name pipelines using `PascalCase` or `Title Case` (e.g., `CriticalAlarmsPipeline`).
  - Avoid generic names like `Pipeline1`.

- **Organize Pipelines Logically**
  - Group pipelines in folders by purpose, such as `Critical`, `Informational`, or `Maintenance`.

- **Design for Scalability**
  - Use modular pipeline blocks that can be reused in multiple pipelines.
  - Keep pipeline designs simple to improve maintainability.

- **Include Failover Paths**
  - Always define alternative actions if primary notification paths fail (e.g., email server downtime).

- **Limit Notification Frequency**
  - Use delay and debounce blocks to reduce duplicate or excessive notifications.

- **Prioritize Alarms**
  - Separate high-priority alarms from low-priority ones to ensure critical issues are addressed first.

## Advanced Tips

- **Leverage Scripting**
  - Use scripting to add dynamic behavior to pipelines, such as recipient selection based on conditions.
  - Example: Notify the on-call technician during weekends.

- **Test Pipelines Thoroughly**
  - Simulate various alarm scenarios to ensure pipelines behave as expected.
  - Use Ignitionâ€™s Alarm Pipeline Diagnostics to troubleshoot issues.

- **Integrate with External Systems**
  - Connect to third-party systems like Slack or Microsoft Teams using scripting or API calls for alarm delivery.

- **Audit Notifications**
  - Enable logging to track when and to whom notifications were sent for auditing and debugging purposes.

## Common Use Cases

- **Escalation Pipelines**
  - Notify first-level responders, and escalate to higher levels if the alarm is not acknowledged within a defined time.

- **Time-Based Notifications**
  - Route alarms to different recipients based on time of day or shifts.

- **Grouped Notifications**
  - Combine multiple alarms into a single notification to reduce the volume of messages.
