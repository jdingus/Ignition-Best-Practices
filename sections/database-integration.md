# Database Integration Best Practices

## Overview
Databases are integral to many Ignition projects, storing historical data, configurations, and more. Proper database design and integration practices ensure reliability, scalability, and efficient data retrieval.

## Tips and Recommendations

- **Use Consistent Naming Conventions**
  - Use `snake_case` for table and column names for better readability and compatibility.
  - Example: `production_line_status` or `machine_runtime_hours`.

- **Primary Key Standards**
  - Use `id` as the primary key for all tables.
  - Set it as an auto-incrementing integer for simplicity.

- **Foreign Key Standards**
  - Name foreign keys in the format `referenced_table_id`.
  - Example: `machine_id` references the `id` field in the `machines` table.

- **Optimize Indexing**
  - Add indexes to frequently queried columns to improve query performance.
  - Use composite indexes for columns often queried together.

- **Avoid SELECT * Queries**
  - Specify the required columns explicitly to reduce data transfer and improve readability.

- **Partition Historical Data**
  - Use database partitioning to manage large datasets efficiently.
  - Partition tables by time (e.g., daily or monthly) for historical data like tag history.

- **Normalize Data Where Appropriate**
  - Reduce redundancy by normalizing database designs while balancing performance needs.

- **Use Transactions for Critical Operations**
  - Wrap critical operations in transactions to maintain data integrity during failures.

## Advanced Tips

- **Named Queries**
  - Use Ignition’s Named Queries for parameterized and reusable database interactions.
  - Organize queries into folders for better manageability.

- **Connection Pooling**
  - Monitor database connections in Ignition’s Gateway and adjust the pool size as needed.

- **Testing and Debugging**
  - Test queries in Ignition’s Database Query Browser before implementing them in production.
  - Log slow queries and optimize them periodically.

- **Backup and Recovery**
  - Automate regular database backups to prevent data loss.
  - Document the restoration process and test it periodically.
