## Tips and Recommendations

- **Use Clear and Descriptive Names**
  - Name reports using `PascalCase` or `Title Case` for consistency (e.g., `MonthlyProductionReport`).
  - Avoid generic names like `Report1`.

- **Organize Reports**
  - Group related reports in folders for clarity (e.g., `Production`, `Maintenance`).

- **Optimize Data Sources**
  - Use Named Queries or Stored Procedures to retrieve data efficiently.
  - Avoid complex inline queries in report configurations.

- **Parameterize Reports**
  - Use parameters to make reports dynamic and reusable.
  - Example: A `startDate` and `endDate` parameter for time-range filtering.

- **Page Layout and Design**
  - Use consistent font sizes, styles, and alignments.
  - Break large tables into multiple pages for readability.
  - Include page numbers and a clear title on each page.

- **Charting Best Practices**
  - Choose the appropriate chart type for the data.
  - Simplify charts by limiting the number of series or data points displayed.

- **Testing Reports**
  - Test reports with various parameter values to ensure proper behavior.
  - Check data accuracy and visual alignment across all output formats (PDF, Excel, etc.).

## Advanced Tips

- **Scheduling Reports**
  - Use the Reporting Moduleâ€™s scheduling feature to automate report generation and distribution.
  - Example: Email a daily production report to stakeholders.

- **Optimize Performance**
  - Cache frequently used data to reduce database load.
  - Simplify report layouts by minimizing the use of embedded sub-reports.

- **Multi-Language Support**
  - Use Ignition's Translation Manager to localize text within reports for different languages.

- **Custom Scripts**
  - Use scripting to add advanced functionality, such as conditional formatting or custom calculations.
