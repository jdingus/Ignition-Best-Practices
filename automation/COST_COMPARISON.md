## FAQ

### Q: I already pay $100/month for Claude Code. Will this cost me more?

**A:** If you use the **Claude Code method**, NO! It uses your existing subscription at no extra cost. If you use the API script, yes, you'll pay per-token on top of your subscription.

### Q: How much does the API script actually cost per article?

**A:** Approximately $0.01-0.05 per article, depending on article length. Processing 100 articles would cost roughly $1-5.

### Q: Can I use Claude Code for automation?

**A:** Not easily. Claude Code requires interactive use. For automation (GitHub Actions, scheduled tasks, etc.), you need the API script.

### Q: Which method is faster?

**A:** The API script is slightly faster (15-30 seconds vs 30-60 seconds), but the difference is negligible for manual use.

### Q: Can I use both methods?

**A:** Absolutely! Use Claude Code for daily manual processing (FREE), and the API script for occasional batch automation when needed.

### Q: I have the free Anthropic API tier. Can I use that?

**A:** Yes! The free tier includes some credits. Once those run out, you'll need to pay per-token or switch to the Claude Code method.
