A maintainer will process this issue using Claude Code:

claude
> Process issue #XX - ingest the URL
```

**How it works:**
1. Claude uses the `content-ingest` skill (automatically!)
2. Fetches and analyzes the URL
3. Updates the appropriate section files
4. Shows what was added

**Cost:** $0 - uses existing Claude Code subscription!
